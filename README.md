## AlphaZero implementation using the python-chess library

The purpose of this project is to reproduce a simpler version of the AlphaZero algorithm developped by DeepMind explained in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815). I then tried to implement the model specifically for chess. I decided to simplify the problem, decreasing the size of the input features, to obtain a faster implementation. This repository is however not finished yet, the training function and the AlphaLoss function are still to be implemented. This project allowed me to better understand some sections of RL, also looking up at some techniques like AlphaBeta Search or Linear Bandit algorithms.
This repository is divided in two main sections:
- The Tree search section (MCTS.py), where I used the python-chess module to implement the Tree Search Graph. The Search section is sometimes very long and the module is probably not suited for this kind of use, which hinders the training of the network
- The Neural Network section that is not finished yet. Thanks to this github [page](https://github.com/geochri/AlphaZero_Chess/blob/master), I could implement the network section. Compared to the AlphaZero paper, I decided to decrease the size of the input features, turning a blind eye on Castling or repetition issues. I started but still need to complete the link between the MCTS and the network section and will then write the AlphaLoss and end up with the train function.
